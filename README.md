# Marven Market Project

This repository contains the project files and documentation for the "Marven Market Project" completed as part of the "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" course on Udemy. The project demonstrates the process of connecting and shaping data, creating a data model, adding DAX measures, and building a comprehensive report using Power BI Desktop.

## Project Overview

The **Marven Market Project** is an in-depth exploration of data analytics using Microsoft Power BI. This project is methodically divided into four major segments:

### 1. Connecting & Shaping the Data
Dive into the initial phase where raw data is transformed into a structured format, ready for insightful analysis. This involves connecting various data sources and meticulously shaping them to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### 2. Creating the Data Model
In this phase, the heart of the project is developed. The data model is crafted to establish relationships between different datasets, setting the stage for seamless data interaction and comprehensive analysis.

### 3. Adding DAX Measures
Here, the power of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is unleashed. Custom measures are created to perform advanced calculations, providing deeper insights and enhancing the analytical capabilities of the data model.

### 4. Building the Report
The final phase brings all the elements together in a visually compelling and interactive report. This report not only showcases the analytical findings but also provides a user-friendly interface for data exploration and decision-making.
